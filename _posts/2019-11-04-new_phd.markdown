Well, weeks quickly turned into multiple months, but the last year has been
especially busy in our new Robotics program.

In other news, I am recruiting for a PhD position on *anticipating a robot's
needs based on past experiences*. The candidate will have the opportunity to
work with a PAL Robotics TIAGo Platinum mobile robot on new and interesting
challenges in cognitive architectures for service robotics. 

If you are interested, please send me an e-mail mentioning the
next-generation HBBA project.
